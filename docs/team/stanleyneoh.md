### Project: Mycelium

**Mycelium** is a desktop application aimed at helping **freelance web developers
manage clients and projects** from multiple online sources like [Upstack](https://upstackhq.com/),
[Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/), and [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/). All interactions
with **Mycelium** are done through text commands or HotKeys, enabling one to efficiently
manipulate data while availing oneself to the convenience of viewing, offered by the
Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. The application is written in Java.

Below are my contributions to the project:
* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=W14&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2023-02-17&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&zFR=false&tabAuthor=StanleyNeoh&tabRepo=AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)

* **Enhancements implemented**: I added the `UiEvent` and its related classes to handle the keyboard events that occur in the UI, allowing the user to perform keyboard shortcuts to navigate the UI and switch to search mode to quickly find projects and clients. I also added `UiAction` Class to enable commands to perform actions to the Ui such as switching to the relevant tab when a project or client command is executed. I added the `Mode` class for the command box, enabling the command box to be stateful and change behaviour depending on its `Mode`.

* **Testing**: I am responsible for testing the `UiAction`, `UiEvent`, `UiEventsManager`, and `Mode` classes and its relevant dependencies.

* **Project management**: I helped enforce the proper use of labels and milestones, ensured that the team is on task with issues.

* **Documentation**:
  * **Contributions to UG**: I am responsible for writing up the *HotKeys* section of the User Guide and assisted in writing up *Ui Overview* section.

  * **Contributions to DG**: I am responsible for writing up the documentation about the *Keyboard Interaction* section, specifically subsections *Hotkey with UiEvents*, and *Command Box*. I also assisted in for writing up the *Command Handling* section, specifically the *Commands* subsection.

* **Contributions to team-based tasks**: I assisted in reviewing and merging PRs, and assisted by making the necessary changes to PRs to ensure that they are up to standard.

* **Review/mentoring contributions**:
